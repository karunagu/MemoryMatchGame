* As a player, when I launch the website, I should see a home page with links pointing to different pages within the website. I should see the following links:
    - Home - Landing page 
    - High Scores - Shows a history of the results of past games I played
    - About Us - This page will show me more details about the website and additional helpful links

- When I land on the home page, I should be able to provide my name to log on and start playing the game.
- In the 'High Scores' page, I want to see a history of the games I played and my scores. When my friend logs in on the same computer, he should be able to see all scores as well. 
- All pictures should be shown initially. When I start the game, they will be shuffled randomly and hidden. I have to choose 1 block first. Then, I should recollect and pick a second block with matching image. 
- During the time I try to click both pictures, they will remain open. If I choose the correct match, both the images will remain open. If I am wrong, both the images will be hidden. Then, I start over all again. I have to memorize the positions and pictures.
- The game will end when I choose all pictures correctly. I can click on the 'High Scores' link and find out how many clicks it took me to finish the game.
